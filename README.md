**YAKL is still a work in progress, and the API is still in flux. Currently this only supports the E3SM-MMF Exascale Computing Project (ECP) application. It is not intended to compete with the more functional portability frameworks. YAKL has a focus on Fortran porting, simplicity, and readability.**

## Example YAKL Usage
